\description{
Selection of 20 rows from the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System. Measures
have been defined as integer values.
}
\details{
The original dataset covers from 1962 to 2016. For each week, in 122 US cities,
mortality figures by age group and cause, considered separately, are included.
In the cause, only a distinction is made between pneumonia or influenza and
others.

The operations to obtain it from the \code{ft} data set are:

ft_num <- ft |>
dplyr::mutate(\verb{Pneumonia and Influenza Deaths} = as.integer(\verb{Pneumonia and Influenza Deaths})) |>
dplyr::mutate(\verb{All Deaths} = as.integer(\verb{All Deaths}))
}
