\usage{
define_facts(
  schema,
  facts = NULL,
  name = NULL,
  measures = NULL,
  agg_functions = NULL,
  nrow_agg = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{schema}{A \code{star_schema} object.}

\item{facts}{A \code{fact_schema} object.}

\item{name}{A string, name of the fact.}

\item{measures}{A vector of measure names.}

\item{agg_functions}{A vector of aggregation function names, each one for its
corresponding measure. If none is indicated, the default is SUM. Additionally
they can be MAX or MIN.}

\item{nrow_agg}{A string, name of a new measure that represents the COUNT
of rows aggregated for each resulting row.}
}
\value{
A \code{star_schema} object.
}
\description{
Facts are part of a \code{star_schema} object. They can be defined directly
as a \code{fact_schema} object or giving the name and a set of measures
that can be empty (does not have explicit measures).
}
\details{
Associated with each measurement there is an aggregation function that can be
SUM, MAX or MIN. AVG is not considered among the possible aggregation
functions: The reason is that calculating AVG by considering subsets of
data does not necessarily yield the AVG of the total data.

An additional measurement corresponding to the COUNT of aggregated rows is
added which, together with SUM, allows us to obtain the mean if needed.
