Description: Data in multidimensional systems is obtained from operational
    systems and is transformed to adapt it to the new structure.
    Frequently, the operations to be performed aim to transform a flat
    table into a ROLAP (Relational On-Line Analytical Processing) star
    database. The main objective of the package is to allow the definition
    of these transformations easily.
