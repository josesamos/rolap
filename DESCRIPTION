Description: Data in multidimensional systems is obtained from 
    operational systems and is transformed to adapt it to the new 
    structure. Frequently, the operations to be performed aim to 
    transform a flat table into a ROLAP (Relational On-Line Analytical 
    Processing) star database. The main objective of the package is 
    to allow the definition of these transformations easily.
