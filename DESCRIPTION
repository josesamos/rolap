Description: Data in multidimensional systems is obtained from operational
    systems and is transformed to adapt it to the new structure.
    Frequently, the operations to be performed aim to transform a flat
    table into a ROLAP (Relational On-Line Analytical Processing) star
    database. The main objective of the package is to allow the definition
    of these transformations easily. The implementation of the multidimensional 
    database obtained can be exported to work with multidimensional analysis 
    tools on spreadsheets or relational databases.
